Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Mattea - discussed using array to collect transcript, using boolean variable to check for if we should use a mirror response. We tried to figure out how to check for "i" without changing it within words, but the solution from in class was neater and more reliable so I changed to that, instead of just checking for " i " or " I ".

Mackenzie - discussed using multiple if statements to check for mirror words, discussed the bug regarding using input nextLine right after nextInt. Our original fix was to called nextLine twice, once before the for loop and then again in it, but I changed this after our discussion in class. I also changed the original layout of using if statements after class.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Sunday 7:00 pm (I attended this and worked on the assignment while there but didn't have any questions)

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it's interesting, my first language was C++ (several years ago) and I always struggled with the different formatting between it and Python so it's nice to return to something more similar. I'm still not really sure how the object oriented approach works so I'm looking forward to working with multiple classes and figuring out what the difference is. 


- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Python is a lot more open, sometimes things worked when they almost felt like they shouldn't. Java is the opposite, which I actually prefer, but it is an adjustment to remember to specify everything again. Additionally, the formatting is a little bit different, such as using indents only for ease of reading and relying more on ";" and "{}". I'm not confident in how the object-oriented approach works enough to really talk about the differences between the layout of code in Python vs Java.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I started this really early, so by the time I actually got around to talking to people I already had a working version. I think it would have been nice to have time to start it in class on Thursday so I could have spoken to people before starting the assignment. I would recommend trying to have your own working version before coming to class on Tuesday because it was fun to mess around with it and then I changed probably 75% of my code after that class to make it more concise and reliable based on what we spoke about. I think that I learned a lot more about programming in Java that way even though most of my current code comes from what we spoke about in class.
